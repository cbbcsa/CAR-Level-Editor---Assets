# CAR-Level-Editor---Assets
This package allows you to make your Own CAR! Levels and share them with friends.

It gives you access to all the Assets you need to make a level for CAR! within the unity editor, then export them as .exe or .app or to any other platform to share with others.

This way allows you to use all the power of the unity editor, whilst making a CAR! Level. This could also be a helpful learning block on the way to learning your way around the unity editor.
